    "You enter a room that is frozen! There are only endless \nplains of ice everywhere you look. You steel yourself and \nmove forward in the bone chilling cold. You have to fight for \nevery step. The faint echo of the wind plays around the rigid \nchunks of ice. Snow crackles under your boots, but you move \nwith a purpose. You think you see movement in the corner of \nyour eye, but it's just your imagination. You are alone.",
    "You step into a room that is on fire!",
    "The room you enter is so bright you can barely keep your eyes \nopen.",
